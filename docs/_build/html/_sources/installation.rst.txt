Installation and Download
=========================

System requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At our institute in Dortmund, crYOLO is running on the following operation systems:

* Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* CentOS 7

We don't test it but it should run on Windows as well.

Moreover the following GPUs are used:

* NVIDIA Titan V
* NVIDIA GTX 1080
* NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti
* NVIDIA RTX 2080 TI
* NVIDIA GV 100

As the GPU accelerated version of tensorflow does not support MacOS, crYOLO does not support it either.

crYOLO depends on CUDA Toolkit and the cuDNN library. These will be automatically installed
during crYOLO installation.
