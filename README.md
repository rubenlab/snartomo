SNARTomo is our set of scripts for on-the-fly tomographic reconstruction. 

The name is derived from the programs that were originally run by it:

  * **S** ee-tee-eff-find-four (CTFFIND4)
  * **N** ewstack, from IMOD
  * **AR** e **Tomo**

We since added other functionalities, such as MotionCor2, IMOD, Topaz, PACE-tomo, and JANNI, but the name remains.
